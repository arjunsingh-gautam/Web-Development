        I think there's been this long cycle of the big companies making a lot of money by underestimating people's
        intelligence and people are used to it now. So, they're so used to having their intelligence underestimated
        that, for most of them, it really isn't worth the bother of paying a little more attention to something that
        might hit them on a deeper level. But you can't really read people's minds.
